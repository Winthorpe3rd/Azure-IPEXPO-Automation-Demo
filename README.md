# Azure-IPEXPO-Automation-Demo
Azure IaaS Automation script demo
PowerShell to build all of the various components that a particular VM requires in Azure to eventually come up with a fully-functioning Azure VM.

At its most basic, an ARM VM requires eight individual components

- A resource group
- A virtual network
- A storage account
- A network interface
- A public IP address (if you need to access it from the Internet)
- An operating system
- An operating system disk
- The VM itself

Please modify the script with your own variables and have a play on Azure :)
